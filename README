rino -- Remove files by inode number

Description
-----------

Remove the files in the current directory
that refer to a given inode number.

Example
-------

If you have a file that can't be removed by
name, you can try this:

	$ ls -i
	3090810 foo	3085281 ?

Once you get the inode number for the file you want
to delete, use find to remove it:

	$ find . -inum 3085281 -exec rm '{}' ';'

Instead of using find, you can use `rino`:

	$ rino 3085281

Installation
------------

Grab `rino`, then run:

	$ make rino

Copy the executable anywhere in your path.
